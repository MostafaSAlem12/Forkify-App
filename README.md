<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://mostafa-forkify.netlify.app/)

This project is a part of the course provided by jonas and owner reserved the rights. You can check the course at the below link. 

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease
servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.

### Built With

This app is built with pure vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and SCSS. It uses webpack as module bundler and NPM as package manager.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
